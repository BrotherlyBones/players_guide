/*
first idea: array
put every object in an array as a string and ask for which to target
include a way to back out of a decision
make it so the first letter of each word in the item is not case-sensitive by including OR statements
include comments for where to call other classes' methods such as deducting cash and displaying the inventory/

assignment requires i use a switch statement,
shouldn't be too hard and is probably exactly what i was thinking of doing anyway
